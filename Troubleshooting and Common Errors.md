| Unable to build multiple predictions on the same object. | Einstein supports multiple predictions on the same object, but if you try to build them out in quick succession, Einstein will only build on the first one. We recommend creating one prediction a day on the same object. |
| Unable to predict values in a picklist. | Einstein Prediction Builder currently only supports binary classification, so the picklist values can be mapped to either a checkbox field or formula field. The return value must be a numeric field or a checkbox. Make sure to run a report on new formula fields to confirm its populated correctly. |
| What does it mean when the filters are showing incorrect information? | The first filter (Segment Screen) is a global filter, which means that records included there will be excluded from both training and scoring. The second filter (Examples Screen) is a training filter. This is the screen you use to differentiate between the example set and the scoring set. In Einstein Prediction Builder, when you create a segment, the model and prediction only concentrate on the data within the segment. The segmented data is split into the example and scoring set. The segmented data includes records that are ignored because they’re irrelevant to the prediction or may pollute the dataset. The example set includes all records used for learning. This includes both positive and negative examples to learn from. The scoring set is the records on which you want a prediction. |
| When reviewing the scorecard, model quality is too good to be true (>95%). | When the model quality is too high, we usually suspect hindsight bias. Einstein detects and removes any fields susceptible to hindsight bias, but it’s always good to double check your dataset for other fields that should be removed. |
| When reviewing the scorecard, model quality is too low. | This usually occurs when too many fields have been removed from the example set. There are not enough predictive fields left to make a strong prediction. Try including more fields in the example set and running the model again. |
