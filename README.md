## Einstein Platform

A model is a machine learning construct used to solve a classification problem.  The model learns from data instead of from explicit rules.  


### Sales Cloud Einstein
 * __Einstein Activity Capture__ - Sales reps just connect their email and calendar to Salesforce. Then, their activities are automatically added to related Salesforce records. Plus, emails sent from Salesforce go through their regular email account.
 * __Einstein Lead Scoring__ - gives each lead a score based on how well it matches your company’s particular lead conversion patterns.  Einstein Lead Scoring shows you exactly which details about each lead have the greatest effect on its score.  Predictive Lead Scoring constantly adjusts its analysis in order to discover any new patterns that emerge.
 * __Opportunity Insights__ - uses machine learning and sentiment analysis to help sales reps close more deals. The same data collection that’s used to log customer data and identify the best leads can also move the sales needle. Insights are tailored to the patterns and data specific to your organization.
